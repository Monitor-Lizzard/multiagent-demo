# MultiAgentDemo

This demo app provides two examples for showcasing the use of the Whisperer MultiAgent framework. The first example is simple, showing how to create multiple agents that execute simple functions. The second example uses LLMs to drive the agents.

For the demos, we're using the age long BODMAS problem used by highschoolers for determining the order of operations in a mathematical expression.

These examples demonstrate the extensible nature of the Whisperer MultiAgent framework.
